# PLUGIN_NAME: De-Sloppify Pass
# PLUGIN_PHASE: task
# PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION: Quality cleanup pass after each development round — removes code slop
#
# Inspired by the De-Sloppify Pattern from the autonomous-loops methodology.
# Instead of adding negative instructions to the main prompt (which degrades quality),
# this runs a separate focused cleanup pass.

- Redundant type checks that the type system already enforces
- Over-defensive error handling for impossible states
- Console.log/print debug statements
- Commented-out code blocks
- Unnecessary TODO comments

Keep all business logic tests and meaningful error handling.
Run the test suite after cleanup to ensure nothing breaks.
Make minimal, surgical changes only." 2>&1 | head -50
